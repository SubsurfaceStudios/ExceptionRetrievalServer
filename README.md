# ExceptionRetrievalServer
Fetch &amp; decryption server designed to be 100% seperate from the Compensation API and block all external HTTP requests for maximized privacy &amp; security.

This has been archived along with the main API repository. NOTE: The CVR client (by default) will not send error reports to unofficial servers to protect users'
privacy. You can only change this behavior via modding.
